# nginx-lua-misc

This is a Docker image that builds nginx with a couple of extensions:

- [ngx\_devel\_kit](https://github.com/simplresty/ngx_devel_kit)
    > The NDK is an Nginx module that is designed to extend the core functionality of the excellent Nginx webserver in a way that can be used as a basis of other Nginx modules.
      

- [ngx\_http\_lua\_module](https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module)
    > Embed the power of Lua into Nginx HTTP Servers.

- [ngx\_set\_misc](https://github.com/openresty/set-misc-nginx-module)
    > Various set_xxx directives added to nginx's rewrite module (md5/sha1, sql/json quoting, and many more)
